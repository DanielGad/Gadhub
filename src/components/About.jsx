            <p>Hello there! I'm Daniel, a passionate front-end developer and creative graphic designer with a love for crafting digital experiences that blend aesthetics and functionality. With two years of experience, I've honed my skills and expertise to bring visions to life on the web.</p>
            <p className='p1'><b>Designing Experiences, One Pixel at a Time</b></p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: 0}}>
            From a young age, I've been captivated by the world of design and technology. This fascination led me to pursue a career that seamlessly merges these two passions. As a graphic designer, I have an eye for detail and a knack for translating ideas into visually appealing designs. Each project is a canvas where I blend colors, typography, and layout to create a visual language that resonates with users.

            <p><b>Bringing Designs to Life through Front-End Development</b></p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: 0}}>
              Design is only half the story. My journey in front-end development began with the desire to bridge the gap between design and functionality. Armed with a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I specialize in turning static designs into interactive and responsive websites. The challenge of creating user-friendly interfaces that not only look stunning but also offer seamless navigation drives my work.
